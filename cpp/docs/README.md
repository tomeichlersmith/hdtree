# Generating hdtree-cpp docs
The hdtree-cpp documentation is generated with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
using the fancy [doxygen-awesome](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) theme
In order to obtain the same styling as the online documentation,
you must make sure the doxygen-awesome submodule is downloaded. You can do this with
```
git submodule update --init
```

You can generate a local copy of the documentation after installing doxygen and sphinx.
We assume that doxygen is run from the root directory of the fire repository.
```
doxygen docs/doxyfile
```

The online documentation includes hyperlinks that jump between the C++ documentation
generated by doxygen and the Python documentation generated by sphinx. These hyperlinks
refer to the root directory of the destination github site and so they **will not** function
when building the documentation locally.

### Diagrams
Specialized diagrams were created with [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) and then exported
to a SVG file for inclusion in the generated HTML. Files ending in `.drawio` are versions of these
diagrams that can be loaded by diagrams.net in order to continue with a current version of the diagram.
Files of the same name but ending in `.svg` are the images actually included in the docs.
