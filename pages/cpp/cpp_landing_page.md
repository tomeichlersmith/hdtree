summary: Getting Started with the C++ HDTree API

## First Steps
This example goes through the four ways of accessing an HDTree.
Each of the four ways has different benefits, so it is up to 
you to decide which one is best for your use case.

## More Intense Use Case
The C++ HDTree API is mainling implemented through its
various `Branch` classes. The `Tree` class is mainly there
to be a helpful interface for handling a set of `Branch`es.
I point this out because if you are interested in building
a larger data processing framework around the C++ HDTree API,
I would suggest focusing on writing your own version of `Tree`
to accomodate your needs rather than attempting to use the `Tree`
that is apart of this repository.
