Offering documentation edits while using it is incredibly helpful. 
Documentation (both manually written and automatically generated) 
is kept on the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository. 

The automatically generated documentation from source code is 
usually more detailed and is done differently depending on the
language being written, so that "API Reference" is kept in separate
sites for each API. Manually written documentation is also 
separated by API, but are all written here and processed by jekyll.
